*Era el* **triangulo** *una figura de tres lados. Y el* **cuadrado**
*una figura cerrada de lados iguales y ángulos rectos. Y el cuadrado
triangular* **era** *en el plano elíptico.*

In the three-sided figure was the triangle.
And the square was a closed figure with equal sides and right angles.
And the triangular square in the elliptical plane.

For Haskell so loved the `world -> (a, world)` that it gave us the
`IO Monad`, that whosoever composes with it should not be impure,
but free of side effects.
