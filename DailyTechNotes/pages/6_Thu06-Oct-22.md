## Axioms of the reals

A non-empty set $R$ together with operations $+, ·$ and ordering $\le$
is called the _real numbers_ if it satisfies:

1. $(R, +, 0)$ is an abelian group
2. $(R\{0}, ·, 1)$ is an abelian group ($1 \ne 0$)
3. Distributive law $x · (y + z) = x·y + x·z$
4. $\le$ is a total order, compatible with $+, ·$ (Archimedean property)
5. Every Cauchy sequence is a convergent sequence
    $$|x| = \begin{cases}
        x \quad &, x \leq 0\\
        -x \quad &, x < 0
    \end{cases}$$
